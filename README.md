# Simple Realm CRUD App

This is a simple app demonstrating the implementation of [Realm](https://pub.dev/packages/realm) for creating a local CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with data persistence.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new entries to your local database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display data stored locally.
- **Update**: Modify existing entries.
- **Delete**: Remove entries from the database.
- **Persistency**: All data is stored locally using Realm, ensuring it is retained across app sessions.

## Realm Integration

This app uses the [Realm](https://pub.dev/packages/realm) package for local data storage. Realm is a fast, easy-to-use local database framework that allows for efficient data handling and persistence.

### Key Benefits of Realm

- **Speed**: Highly optimized for performance.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to integrate and use within a Flutter app.
- **Persistency**: Ensures data is retained between app sessions.
